# MOPAC website

The assets for the MOPAC website are split over multiple repositories to manage the large size and number of files. Most of the web-accessible content of the old website is contained within the [manual](github.com/openmopac/Manual) and [reference data](github.com/openmopac/PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy) repos/subdirectories. All of the new website content will be put in this repository, but the website will still link to this old content. There is too much content in the manual and model accuracy sections of the website to modernize at this time. If the MOPAC user base wants the entire website to be modernized, then they will have to contribute labor and/or financial support to the process. MOPAC is now an open-source project with very limited development resources.

The MOPAC website at the openmopac.net domain also hosts supplementary material for multiple papers, which need to be preserved indefinitely. There is a [summary page](http://openmopac.net/Manual/Publications.html) for supplementary materials on the website. The specific URLs cited by papers are:

- [http://openmopac.net/Chymo.html](http://openmopac.net/Chymo.html) for [An investigation into the applicability of the semiempirical method PM7 for modeling the catalytic mechanism in the enzyme chymotrypsin](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00894-017-3326-8)
- [http://openmopac.net/PM6-ORG](http://openmopac.net/PM6-ORG) for [A semiempirical method optimized for modeling proteins](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00894-023-05695-1)
- [http://openmopac.net/Supporting_information.html](http://openmopac.net/Supporting_information.html) for [Prediction of enzyme inhibition (IC50) using a combination of proteinâ€“ligand docking and semiempirical quantum mechanics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00894-025-06423-7)

During development, this website will be hosted at [https://openmopac.github.io](https://openmopac.github.io). After its initial deployment, the hosting will be switched to the openmopac.net domain, which will retire the old MOPAC website.
