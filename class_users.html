Providing MOPAC to an Academic Class</B></h1>

&nbsp;<p align="left">
The normal procedure for installing MOPAC on a computer is to request a license 
key which would then be used to activate MOPAC.&nbsp; This process can take some 
time, and quite often problems occur with file permissions.&nbsp;
<p align="left">
When MOPAC is to be used by a set of students a simpler procedure can be used.&nbsp; 
This procedure is as follows:<p align="left">
(1) Install MOPAC on one machine using the normal procedure.<p align="left">
(2) Set up the local environment so that the program behaves the way you want it 
to work, i.e., integrate MOPAC with a GUI, develop a process for running jobs, 
etc.<p align="left">
(3) When this is done, copy the folder that holds the MOPAC executable to the 
other machines that are to be used. This folder contains the MOPAC executable 
plus its license key file, so when the folder is copied to a new machine it 
should work immediately, i.e., without needing to be activated.<p align="left">
Step 3 only works when one operating system is used by everyone.&nbsp; If two or 
more OS are used, repeat steps 1 and 2 for each OS, then use step 3 to migrate 
MOPAC on to all machines that use that OS.<p align="left">
