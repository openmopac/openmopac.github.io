MOZYME results are not reproducible</h1>
<p>When a geometry is optimized using <a href="../Manual/mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a>, and a single-point calculation is 
run on the final geometry, sometimes the results of the single-point calculation 
do not match those of the full geometry optimization.&nbsp; This can be very 
frustrating, and can call into question the whole idea of reproducibility.&nbsp; 
So what went wrong?</p>
<h3>Ground-state Systems</h3>
<p>In all cases examined, the same error occurred every time.&nbsp; When a 
MOZYME calculation is run, it starts by building a Lewis structure for the 
system.&nbsp; This Lewis structure is based on the topology of the supplied 
geometry. If the geometry supplied is severely in error, then the Lewis 
structure will have an error.&nbsp; During the geometry optimization, all, or at 
least most, of the geometric errors are corrected by the energy minimization 
procedure.&nbsp; The final geometry will be much better, i.e., will be 
chemically more realistic, than the starting structure.&nbsp; If a single point 
calculation is then run on the final geometry, the correct or more correct Lewis 
structure will be used.&nbsp; Because a more correct structure is used, the 
computed heat of formation will be lower than that of the previous run, unless 
the net charge becomes more positive.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the net charge on the 
system changes in going from the starting geometry to the optimized geometry, 
that indicates a significant change in bonding, a change that should definitely 
be investigated before proceeding any further.</p>
<h4>Corrective procedure</h4>
<p>The procedure for handling this fault is also the same in each case.&nbsp; 
First, do not simply add or remove covalent bonds to fix the fault.&nbsp; It's 
better to regard the failure of MOZYME as an indication of a specific fault in 
the initial data set (although on rare occasions, the fault might be in the 
final data set).&nbsp; Run both the starting and optimized geometries using 
keyword <a href="../Manual/lewis.html"><tt>LEWIS</tt></a>, and compare the 
output files. Go to the bottom of these files, and look for the charges on the 
various atoms.&nbsp; Examine each case where the charges differ.&nbsp; Some 
differences might be due to the formation of salt bridges. When a salt bridge 
forms, a cation and an anion are created; these are natural structures and after identifying them 
(look at them using a GUI), they 
can be ignored.&nbsp;What you're looking for are charges the are 
present in one file but are not present in the other. As each one is found, 
<span class="auto-style1">carefully</span> examine the location of the charge, and determine if it should be 
charged or uncharged.&nbsp; To assist in the examination of the site, use the 
Lewis structure that is printed in the output files.&nbsp; At first, this might 
seem difficult, but after doing it once or twice the procedure becomes quite 
easy.&nbsp; The action that is taken once the fault is positively identified depends on what 
caused the fault.&nbsp; If there is an extra hydrogen atom, or a hydrogen atom 
missing, edit the geometry to suit.&nbsp; If a bond-length is incorrect so that 
the topology is in error, use <a href="../Manual/CVB.html"><tt>CVB</tt></a> to to correct 
the topology.</p>
<p>Once all errors (normally only one) in the data set are identified and 
corrected, re-run the job.</p>
<h3>Transition State Systems </h3>
<p>When locating, optimizing, or characterizing a transition state, a very 
specific problem often occurs.&nbsp; Typically, in a transition state, a 
covalent bond is made or broken.&nbsp; Consider for example, a hydroxyl group 
adding across a peptide bond (-CO-NH-).&nbsp; The transition state might consist 
of the four-membered ring -[O-(C=O)-(NH)-H]-. It would be hard to draw a Lewis 
structure for this system, and the MOZYME technique would normally fail to 
generate an acceptable starting Lewis structure. At first sight, then, it would 
appear that MOZYME cannot be used for modeling transition states, but in fact 
getting transition states to run is straightforward. </p>
<h4>Corrective procedure</h4>
<p>As with ground-state systems, identify the charges associated with the 
transition state.&nbsp; The Lewis structure generator in MOPAC often makes 
mistakes when trying to process transition states.&nbsp; Assuming that it does 
make a mistake in the optimized or 
refined transition state (the commonest scenario), use <a href="../Manual/CVB.html"><tt>CVB</tt></a> 
to make or break bonds so that the topology is simplified.&nbsp; Use the 
topography printed in the output file to characterize the environment of the 
transition state, and to identify the changes that would need to be made in 
order to have a sensible Lewis structure.&nbsp; For example, in the case of the 
four-membered ring just described, if the topography indicates that the atoms 
forming the ring are, in fact, connected, then use <a href="../Manual/CVB.html"><tt>CVB</tt></a> 
to break the "-O-(C=O)-" bond and the "-(NH)-H-" bond.&nbsp; This would then 
result in a simple topography corresponding to the unreacted structure.</p>
