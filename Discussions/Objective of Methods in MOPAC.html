Objective of Methods in MOPAC</h1>
<p>Over the years, the purpose of the methods in MOPAC has steadily changed.&nbsp; 
In the 1980's, their purpose was to reproduce the properties of molecules.&nbsp; 
At that time, the most important properties were heat of formation, geometry, 
dipole moment and ionization potential.&nbsp; The relative importance of each 
property was defined (and still is) defined using weighting factors.&nbsp; As 
time went by it became more and more apparent that accurate reproduction of all 
four properties was simply not possible.&nbsp; Whether this failure was due to 
errors in the set of approximations used, faulty or inadequate reference data, 
incomplete parameter optimization or insufficient skill of the method 
developers, was not important, the fact remained that simultaneous accurate 
prediction of all four properties was not achieved.&nbsp; At the same time, the 
importance of predicting the the purely chemical quantities<span class="auto-style1"> 
D</span>H<sub>f</sub> and geometry increased, and the importance of predicting 
the electronic quantities dipole moment and ionization potential decreased.&nbsp; 
As a result of the changing priorities, the purpose of the more recent methods in MOPAC 
has changed.</p>
<p>As the importance of accurate prediction of chemical properties increased, 
the definition of reference data has had to be re-visited.&nbsp; The first of the 
NDDO methods, MNDO (published in 1977) was a great improvement over even earlier 
methods, but it was so inaccurate that comparison of MNDO results with 
experimental reference data and with high-level computed reference data gave 
essentially the same results.&nbsp; This should not be construed as disparaging 
MNDO - it was much faster than ab-initio methods, and was really the first of 
the modern semiempirical methods.&nbsp; Several other methods were developed 
over the years, and as the accuracy improved the difference between experimental 
reference data and reference data obtained from high-level calculations became 
more and more important. Where experiment and high-level theory agreed, there 
was no problem - obviously either would do as the source of reference data.&nbsp; 
Where they disagreed, a decision had to be made regarding which data to use.&nbsp; 
If an experimental datum was reliable - and often this was hard to determine - 
then that was used, otherwise the theoretical prediction was used.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Current methods&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The two recent methods, PM6 (and its variants, PM6-DH2, PM6-DH+, and PM6-D3) and PM7 
were designed to allow chemical systems to be modeled.&nbsp; This means that 
increased emphasis has been given to geometries and heats of formation, at the 
expense of dipole moments and I.P.s.&nbsp; Because non-covalent interactions are 
important in proteins and other complicated systems, e.g., crystals of organic 
compounds, increased emphasis has been given to long-range effects, specifically 
hydrogen bonds and dispersion effects.&nbsp; Electrostatics are a special case, 
in that these, although very important, are easy to calculate, even in solids.</p>
<p>A consequence of this increased emphasis on chemical properties and weak 
interactions is that properties such as salt bridges,&nbsp;
<span class="auto-style1">p</span> - <span class="auto-style1">p</span> 
interactions, <span class="auto-style1">p</span>-stacking, VDW interactions, 
etc., are now predicted with good accuracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this, PM7 now 
predicts many protein properties with good accuracy.</p>
<p>Despite the increased accuracy, there are several known small but important 
faults in PM7.&nbsp; Two of the most important being the approximations for 
dispersion and for hydrogen bonding.&nbsp; These can amount to 0.2 kcal/mol or 
more.&nbsp; In biochemistry and other branches of organic chemistry, errors in 
non-covalent interactions are considerably more important than the equivalent 
errors in covalent interactions.&nbsp; This is because these interactions, 
although much weaker than covalent interactions, have a greater influence the 
properties of the system.&nbsp; These faults could be removed, but, if that were 
done, it is likely that other faults would appear elsewhere.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Changes to methods after they are released</h3>
<p>&nbsp;First and most important: MOPAC is a computational chemistry tool. Its 
purpose is to allow researchers and students to model chemical phenomena. A 
pre-requisite for this is that each new version of MOPAC, whether it be a big 
version change, e.g. MOPAC2012 going to MOPAC2016, or a small change, version 
13.284 going to version 13.306, should give exactly the same results for the 
same data-set. This requirement for perfect continuity means that a job that had 
been run 10, 20, or even 30 years ago should have the same results as the 
equivalent job run today. Many research programs take years to complete, so 
there is a strong reason to ensure reproducibility. Put another way, MOPAC is 
not intended to be a show-case for semiempirical methods. If it was, then only 
the latest and most accurate methods would be supported, and as improvements are 
made in methodology, those improvements would be immediately incorporated into 
the program. As such, each new version would be the most accurate, but the 
program would then be essentially useless as a research tool, because users 
could not trust that results obtained on one day could be related to results 
obtained on a different day.<br/><br/>There are two exceptions to the rule that 
methods in MOPAC are not changed.<br/><br/>(a) As each new method is released, the 
default method changes to the new method. This could potentially cause 
unpleasant surprises as results obtained with the previous default method would 
change when a new default method is used. To minimize the potential for 
surprises of this type, when a new method is first released there is no default 
method. Jobs will fail unless a method is explicitly specified. Thus before PM7 
became available the default method was PM6. When PM7 became available, MOPAC 
jobs required the method (PM6 or PM7) to be specified as a keyword. After a 
while a default method is re-introduced, so, in the case of PM7, the need to 
explicitly specify the keyword PM7 was dropped after several months.<br/><br/>(b) 
If, after a new method is released, a fault is found that could be corrected by 
a simple change, then that change might be made. The decision of whether or not 
to make the change depends on two competing factors: (1) is the change 
sufficiently important to justify modifying a method, and (2) how much harm 
would result from the change potentially compromising the integrity of research 
projects already underway. With over 18,000 licensed sites world-wide, the 
potential for causing disruption to research projects is obvious. Because of 
this, only important changes are made to methods, and then only in the first few 
months after a method is released. That is, at a time when a user's investment 
in effort is still small and it would still be easy for users to re-run jobs. 
The procedure for making such a change is similar to that for introducing a new 
method, i.e., a keyword to alert the user to the change is required and then, 
after a few months, the changed method becomes the default.<br/><br/>At the time 
when a new method is being designed, all the notes on faults in the existing 
current method and on suggestions for improvement are reviewed, and, where 
appropriate, incorporated into the design of the new method. After a method has been available for many months, and a fault is discovered 
in that method or a change is made that results in a significant improvement in 
accuracy, no action is taken to modify the method to eliminate the fault or to 
implement the improvement.&nbsp; To do so would cause more harm to the large 
number of users whose projects would be affected by the change.&nbsp; Instead, a 
note is made of the issue.&nbsp; For an example of such notes, see
<a href="../Manual/PM6_accuracy.html">PM6 Accuracy</a> and
<a href="../PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy/Faults_specific_to_PM7.html">PM7 Faults</a>. Later on, 
when a new 
method is being designed, all the notes on faults in the existing current method 
and on suggestions for improvement are reviewed, and where appropriate, 
incorporated into the design of the new method.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
