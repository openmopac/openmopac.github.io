Intermolecular interactions</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the purpose of this discussion, only the simplest of interacting species 
will be considered, i.e., precisely two species, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>
B</strong>.&nbsp; These can be monatomic, e.g. Hg, monatomic ions, e.g. [Cl]<sup>-</sup>, 
polyatomic molecules, e.g., aniline, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>, 
or polyatomic ions, e.g. hydrogen sulfate, [HSO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup>. There 
are several types of intermolecular interactions involving <strong>A</strong> 
and <strong>B</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Covalent" - arising from quantum chemical contributions.&nbsp; Since 
	intermolecular interactions imply the absence of covalent interactions (the 
	distance between the interacting species is too large, by definition) there 
	are no covalent bonds, <em>per se</em>, but there are very small energy 
	contributions resulting from the overlap of atomic orbitals.&nbsp; These 
	contributions are small relative to the other intermolecular interactions, 
	and indeed become vanishingly small outside about two times the covalent 
	distance, and can thus also be ignored in this discussion.<br/></li>
<li>Electrostatic - arising from the partial charge on each atom, <strong>a</strong>, 
	in <strong>A</strong> interacting with the partial charge on each atom,
	<strong>b</strong>, in <strong>B</strong>. Electrostatic interactions 
	decrease only slowly with distance, the energy falling off as the reciprocal 
	of the interatomic distance, i.e., as 1/(R<strong>ab</strong>). Although 
	they can be large, electrostatic terms are simple to calculate and will not 
	be considered further.<br/></li>
<li>Dispersion, otherwise known as van der Waals or VDW interactions, or 
	London forces - arising from the instantaneous correlation of electrons.&nbsp; 
	Like most quantum chemical theoretical methods, NDDO-type semiempirical 
	methods use molecular orbitals to solve the Hartree-Fock equations.&nbsp; 
	This is an approximation to the correct wavefunction, a good approximation, 
	but not perfect.&nbsp; The use of M.O.s implies that the motion of the 
	electrons is not correlated.&nbsp; Correlation of electrons is a 
	time-dependent phenomenon, and results when one electron interacts with 
	another electron.&nbsp; At each instant of time, the two electrons will 
	endeavor to avoid each other, because of electrostatic repulsion.&nbsp; 
	Dispersion energies can be quite large for nearby atoms, but fall of as the 
	sixth power of the distance, i.e., as 1/(R<strong>ab</strong>)<sup>6</sup>.<br/>
</li>
<li>Hydrogen bonds - a unique type of interaction that typically involves 
	three atoms, with the middle atom being hydrogen.&nbsp; The commonest 
	hydrogen bonds are of the type O-H - O and O-H - N. Hydrogen bonds could be 
	regarded as a special case of electrostatics, dispersion and covalent 
	interactions, but because of their great importance, and because they are 
	not, in practice, well reproduced by these other terms, they are now added 
	in <em>post-hoc</em> to the energy terms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dispersion terms</h3>
<p>Dispersion terms are particularly hard to calculate <em>de novo</em>.&nbsp; 
The strategy used in MOPAC is to use published benchmark calculations as a 
source of specific intermolecular interaction energies.&nbsp; In PM7, these are 
then used in parameterizing a simple function in the parameter optimization 
procedure used in developing a new method. In PM6-DH2 and PM6-DH+ the method 
described in "A Transferable H-bonding Correction For Semiempirical 
Quantum-Chemical Methods" Martin Korth, Michal Pitonak, Jan Rezac and Pavel 
Hobza, J Chem Theory and Computation 6:344-352 (2010) is used.&nbsp; In PM6-D3, 
the method used is described in "A consistent and accurate ab initio 
parametrization of density functional dispersion correction (DFT-D) for the 94 
elements H-Pu"&nbsp; S. Grimme, J. Antony, S. Ehrlich, H. Krieg, THE JOURNAL OF 
CHEMICAL PHYSICS 132, 154104 .2010.&nbsp; Published reports indicate that the 
most accurate semiempirical method for predicting intermolecular interaction 
energies is PM6-D3H4.&nbsp; This method has not been included in MOPAC, because 
by the time all the other methods had been included, enthusiasm for yet another 
method had vanished see also below.</p>
<h3>Hydrogen bond terms</h3>
<p>The energy correction due to a hydrogen bond is quite large, in the order of 
several kcal/mol.&nbsp; Despite it being so important, the functional forms of 
the hydrogen bond have been developed using purely pragmatic reasoning&nbsp; 
rather than by deductive science.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is known experimentally 
that the most important hydrogen bonds involve oxygen, then nitrogen, then other 
atoms and ions such as sulfur and chloride; that the bonds are more-or-less 
linear; and that they depend on the local net charge in the region of the bond.&nbsp; 
Thus a hydrogen bond between two acetic acid molecules would be weaker than 
between an acetic acid molecule and an acetate ion. The extra energy of a 
charged hydrogen bond is reflected in a reduced distance between the two 
non-hydrogen atoms in a hydrogen bond.</p>
<p>Several approaches have been proposed for modeling the hydrogen bond, with 
the best being the -DH2, -NH+, and -D3H4, with -D3H4 being the most accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The approach used in PM7 can best be described as a mixture of -DH2 and -DH+ 
with a special correction for charged hydrogen bonds.&nbsp; The resulting 
approximation is by no means optimal, but does capture most of the phenomena 
associated with hydrogen bonds.&nbsp; Because it is not optimal, it should not 
be regarded as definitive, in other words, when a better approximation is 
developed, the current approximation in PM7 should be replaced.&nbsp; Why was 
-D3H4 not used?&nbsp; Simply put, after implementing the earlier approximations, 
I ran out of enthusiasm to implement the final, best, approximation.</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Approximations for modeling both dispersion and hydrogen bonding terms have 
been evolving rapidly.&nbsp; At the present time, 2013, a clear description of 
this topic appears to be appearing:&nbsp; Terms of the type developed by Grimme, 
i.e., the D3 terms, represent the dispersion effect with very good accuracy, and 
should be used, without modification, in the development of all future methods.&nbsp; 
This had several advantages, among these are: (A) Because the dispersion effect 
is completely separate from all other effects, it can be treated separately. (B) 
By not using any parameters for the dispersion effect, the number of parameters 
in a new method is reduced - always a desirable objective. (C) By using a "black 
box" to represent dispersion effects, the potential of introducing 
distance-dependent artifacts into a new method is reduced.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 
at the time PM7 was completed, this insight had not been developed.</p>
<p>The status of hydrogen bonding approximations is less clear.&nbsp; When 
PM6-DH2 was developed, a small theoretical error was introduced: the hydrogen bond energy was made a function of the partial charge on 
the hydrogen atom.&nbsp; This weakened the electronic variational principle, 
because now the energy minimum depended on the post-SCF hydrogen bond partial 
charge.&nbsp; A consequence of this violation was that the energy gradient norm 
no longer went to zero at the energy minimum, and as a result geometry 
optimization became ill-defined.&nbsp; The error was small, and for most systems 
could be neglected.&nbsp; The most important practical effect was that geometry 
optimization became less efficient and as a result took more cycles, i.e., more 
CPU time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The error in PM6-DH2 was corrected in PM6-DH+, by making the hydrogen bond 
energy independent of partial charge.&nbsp; But now a new error was introduced in 
PM6-DH+ where for some highly specific systems there was a discontinuity in the 
second derivative of the energy with respect to geometry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In PM7, both of the errors in PM6-DH2 and PM6-DH+ were removed, and the 
behavior of the hydrogen bond improved.&nbsp; In recent months, various faults 
in the shape of the hydrogen bond have been described.</p>
<p>These problems with the hydrogen bond illustrate the fact that approximations 
for the hydrogen bond are still evolving.&nbsp; The problem to be addressed is 
clear, it is only the approximation that describes the hydrogen bond that is not 
clear. of organic compounds.</p>
