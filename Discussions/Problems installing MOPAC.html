<h1><font face="Arial">Problems installing MOPAC</font></h1>
<p>While most users install MOPAC without problems, some users have 
difficulties getting MOPAC to work.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing difficulties, please carry out&nbsp; the following 
instructions before asking for help</p>
<h3>Using MOPAC with Chem3D</h3>
<p>See: <a href="/Chem3D.html">
http://openmopac.net/chem3D.html</a></p>
<h3>Problems getting the license key to install </h3>
<p>Make sure you have permission to write to the folder that contains the MOPAC 
executable.<br/>
This issue affects Windows, Linux, 
and Mac computers.&nbsp; <br/>
The default location of the folder that holds MOPAC depends on your operating system.<br/>
If you cannot set the permissions to read and write to files in the default 
folder, then change the location of 
the MOPAC&nbsp;folder by using an Environmental Variable.<br/>
A suitable place is your home directory, in a folder called, e.g., &lt;your_name&gt;/mopac</p>
<h3>Even with a new copy of MOPAC, the message that the program has expired 
still appears</h3>
<p>The expiry date for academic versions is stored in the MOPAC executable, not in the license key. 
Please delete all MOPAC executables, then try to run MOPAC again - obviously 
this attempt should fail because you've already deleted the executables. If 
MOPAC tries to run, continue deleting MOPAC executables.<br/><br/>Once MOPAC does 
not try to run, download and install a new MOPAC executable. </p>
<p>If MOPAC still will not work, then do the following:</p>
<p>Completely empty the folder that contains the MOPAC executable.<br/>
Carry out the instructions for installing MOPAC.<br/>
Make a note of each instruction that you do, and also make a note of what the 
computer response is.<br/>
When the problem occurs, stop, and send your notes to
<a href="mailto:openmopac@gmail.com">openmopac@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Missing libraries in Linux systems</h3>
<p>CentOS 6.3 (a RedHat derivative) does not install 32-bit libraries, which 
normally reside in the directory /lib , nor does it even offer the opportunity 
to do so at installation time.<br/>
However, these libraries can be easily obtained by doing two steps:<br/>
# yum install glibc.i686 and after that is done,<br/>
# yum install libgcc_s.so.1<br/>
The folder /lib now contains the libraries and links that were originally 
missing.<br/>
<br/>
Then run<br/>
# /installdirectory/MOPAC2016.exe {license}<br/>
without a hitch.</p>
<h3>Libraries exist, but are not "seen" by MOPAC, in Linux systems</h3>
<p>If MOPAC will not run because it needs the library libimf.so, and you find 
that the library exists as:&nbsp; /opt/intel/fc/9.0/lib/libimf.so, the adding 
this to the .bashrc file might help:<br/><br/>LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/intel/fc/9.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"<br/>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH"</p>
<h3>Linux gives the message "FATAL: kernel too old, Segmentation fault."</h3>
<p>The version of Linux is out-of-date.&nbsp; Either update the version of Linux 
or create a virtual machine that will run an up-to-date operating system.&nbsp; 
Versions of MOPAC for old OS are not supported.</p>
<h3>Error message "error while loading shared libraries: libiomp5.so: cannot 
open shared object file: No such file or directory"</h3>
<p>You will need to install the shared library. To do this, proceed as follows:<br/>
(A) Copy libiomp5.so from the MOPAC distribution zip file to the folder /opt/mopac/<br/>
(B) Edit your .bashrc or .cshrc to include the line:<br/>export 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/mopac<br/>(C) Run the start-up script, that is, run the 
command: "source .bashrc" This will export the library.<br/></p>
<h3>MOPAC does not run on Leopard, Snow Leopard, or Lion.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;MOPAC2016 for Mac computers run on Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) and 
higher.&nbsp; </p>
