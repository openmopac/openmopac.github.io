(<a href="Discussion_topics.html">back to discussion topics</a>)<h1 align="center" dir="rtl">&nbsp; Accuracy and Precision in MOPAC </h1>
<p>There are three quantities that need to be carefully described in order to 
understand the significance of numerical values generated by MOPAC: Accuracy, 
reproducibility and precision.&nbsp; First, some definitions:</p>
<p><strong><a href="#Accuracy">Accuracy</a></strong>:&nbsp; A comparison of the results obtained by 
calculation with the values of reference data.&nbsp; This is usually expressed 
in terms of Average Unsigned Errors for various quantities, See
<a href="../PM7_and_PM6-D3H4_accuracy/Accuracy%20of%20PM7%20and%20PM6-D3H4.html">accuracy</a> for PM7 for examples and 
details.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#Reproducibility">Reproducibility</a></strong>: A method such as PM7 consists of a set of 
approximations and a set of parameters.&nbsp; Such methods can be used in 
programs such as MOPAC, that can be run on different operating systems, e.g., 
Windows, Linux, and MAC, that run in various architectures, i.e., 32 or 64 
bit, using variable numbers of processors (threads), typically 1 to 12 threads.&nbsp; 
Results obtained&nbsp; from running the same system using different programs, 
OS, architectures, and number of threads, should be the same. In addition, 
unless a method is very deliberately changed, results obtained at one time 
should be reproducible at any later date. </p>
<p><strong><a href="#Precision">Precision</a></strong>: The number of significant figures in a printed 
quantity.&nbsp; </p>
<h2><strong><a name="Accuracy">Accuracy</a></strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;The recent semiempirical methods (PM6 and PM7) in MOPAC are only good 
for modeling chemical systems, i.e., for predicting the geometries of various 
species and their heats of formation.&nbsp; For non-chemical properties, such as 
ionization potentials and dipole moments, or electronics in general, these 
methods are of low accuracy. </p>
<h2><a name="Reproducibility">Reproducibility</a></h2>
<p>In principle, the results of calculations run using a specific method on a 
well-defined system should be independent of all variables such as software, 
operating system, architecture, etc.&nbsp; In practice, this is normally does 
not happen - there are small differences.&nbsp; Despite the fact that all 
versions of MOPAC use the same software, and all versions are compiled using the 
same compiler (the Intel Fortran compiler), there are small differences in the 
results.&nbsp; These differences can be attributed to a small number of specific 
factors:</p>
<p>(A) Finite convergence criteria are used.&nbsp; In the SCF calculation, the 
optimization of the wavefunction is terminated when a pre-set criterion is 
satisfied.&nbsp; In geometry optimization, the process is stopped when the 
gradients fall below a pre-set limit. These criteria were selected to minimize 
run-times while not significantly compromising the results.&nbsp; If better 
convergence is needed, the criteria can be tightened, e.g., by adding <tt>
<a href="../Manual/relscf.html">RELSCF=0.1</a></tt> 
(for the SCF criterion) or <tt><a href="../Manual/gnorm.html">GNORM=0.5</a></tt> (for geometries), or, in general, by adding 
<tt><a href="../Manual/precise.html">PRECISE</a></tt>.</p>
<p>(B) Although the same software is used on all platforms, differences in the 
operating systems can alter the math used in subtle ways.&nbsp; All arithmetic 
is carried out to 16 digit precision, but the last digit can have an uncertainty 
of &plusmn;1.&nbsp; This uncertainty can become greater as more and more math is 
carried out, and in some cases can result in a degradation from 16 digit 
precision to five or even fewer digits.&nbsp; In most cases, this loss of numerical 
precision can, perhaps surprisingly, be corrected by tightening up the 
convergence criteria.&nbsp; With the default criteria, the path from the 
starting function (electronic or geometric) to the function that satisfies the 
criteria can differ from one machine to another.&nbsp; But if the criteria are 
tightened up, the final functions will also be more tightly defined, and 
differences in the paths taken to reach the optimum point will become less and 
less important.</p>
<p>(C) Even on one machine, if the same job is run several times, small 
differences can be detected.&nbsp; This effect occurs only on multi-processor machines, 
and only when multi-thread calculations (the default) are run.&nbsp; In this 
case, the differences originate in the changing sequence of operations that can 
occur when multi-processing is done.&nbsp; This type of error can be eliminated 
by using only one thread, using <a href="../Manual/threads.html"><tt>THREADS=1</tt></a>, or 
by limiting processes to one core.</p>
<p>(D) There are two very different methods in MOPAC for solving the 
self-consistent equations: (1) Conventional SCF methods, that use matrix 
algebra, and scale as the cube of the size of the system. (1) A Localized 
Molecular Orbital method, <a href="../Manual/mozyme_introduction.html">MOZYME</a>, that uses Lewis structures to general LMOs.&nbsp; 
SCF calculations run using <a href="../Manual/mozyme.html"><tt>MOZYME</tt></a> scale as the size of system to the power 1.4, 
i.e., almost linear scaling. MOZYME was written to allow protein systems 
(protein plus water plus hetero groups, e.g., substrates) to be run in a 
reasonable time.&nbsp; Currently, MOZYME&nbsp; is limited to RHF systems.&nbsp; 
Results calculated using conventional methods and using MOZYME should be the 
same.&nbsp; In practice,&nbsp; because of different criteria, there are small 
differences.&nbsp; These differences can be made arbitrarily small by tightening 
criteria (under keyword control) but if that is done, the compute effort would 
increase to the point that MOZYME would take the same time as conventional.&nbsp; 
In most cases where MOZYME gives a significantly different result from 
conventional, and the MOZYME heat of formation is greater than the conventional, 
MOZYME has converged on an electronic excited state.&nbsp; In the remaining 
cases, the conventional SCF has converged on an electronic excited state/</p>
<h2><a name="Precision">Precision</a></h2>
<p>In this context, precision is the number of significant digits in a quantity 
that is printed.&nbsp; The internal precision of the calculation is not readily 
accessible to the user, and is therefore essentially irrelevant.&nbsp; In most 
cases, the precision used in the output and related files is within two or three 
digits of the internal precision of the calculation. If higher or lower 
precision is needed, use <a href="../Manual/auxiliary.html"><tt>AUX</tt></a> to 
output 
results to the required precision.</p>
<p>Semiempirical methods have limited accuracy, so although the AUE for
<span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> might be 4 or 5 kcal/mol, the 
precision of the results will typically be 10<sup>-6</sup> kcal/mol.&nbsp; For 
most work, the precision of <span class="b">&Delta;</span>H<sub>f</sub> 
should be truncated to 0.1 kcal/mol.</p>
