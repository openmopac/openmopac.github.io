<TITLE>Setting up MOPAC 2016 for use in Chem3D</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY vLink=#0000ff link=#0000ff>
<h1 align="center" dir="rtl">&nbsp; Setting up MOPAC2016 for use in Chem3D Ultra</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chem3D Ultra (but not Chem3D) can run MOPAC jobs.&nbsp; Here are the instructions on how to install 
MOPAC2016 so that it will run inside Chem3D Ultra.</p>
<p>Before starting, make sure that there are no copies of MOPAC already on your 
machine.&nbsp; Search the &quot;C&quot; partition for files with the name MOPAC*.exe&nbsp; 
If you find any, then if its name is MOPAC2012.exe re-name it to MOPAC2012 
(old).exe, or if its any other MOPAC executable, delete it.</p>
<p>Go to web-page: <a href="/Download_MOPAC_Executable_Step2.html">
http://openmopac.net/Download_MOPAC_Executable_Step2.html</a></p>
<p>Download &quot;stand-alone 64-bit MOPAC2016 for Windows&quot;.&nbsp; This is a zip 
file.&nbsp; Open the zip file, and using the instructions in the file 
&quot;Installation instructions.txt&quot;, install MOPAC on the machine where you will be 
running Chem3D Ultra.</p>
<p>Run a test on stand-alone MOPAC2016 to make sure it works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At the present time, Chem3D Ultra looks in the folder &quot;C:\Program 
Files\MOPAC&quot; for the files &quot;MOPAC2012.exe&quot; and &quot;password for MOPAC2012&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If these files are present, Chem3D Ultra will be able to run MOPAC jobs.&nbsp; At 
present, March 2016, Chem3D Ultra 
will not recognize &quot;MOPAC2016.exe&quot;.&nbsp; To get MOPAC2016 to work inside Chem3D 
Ultra, make 
a copy of &quot;MOPAC2016.exe&quot; and re-name the copy &quot;MOPAC2012.exe&quot;.&nbsp; Make a copy of 
&quot;password for MOPAC2016&quot; and re-name the copy &quot;password for MOPAC2012&quot;</p>
<p>If Chem3D Ultra is running, shut it down.&nbsp; Start Chem3D Ultra running, and MOPAC2016 
should then run correctly. To verify this, look at the start of the output from 
MOPAC; it should say &quot;MOPAC2016&quot; and not &quot;MOPAC2012&quot;</p>
<p>If you only have ChemDraw or Chem3D, these will not run MOPAC, you'll need Chem3D Ultra.</p>
